Hi there! 

My personal projects and open-source contributions are displayed on my GitHub profile. 
I place a high value on producing clear, manageable, and well-documented code, and I think tests should be written. ðŸ¤“

Kindly contact me if you have questions.\n
I'm willing to work with others, give my services, and contribute to projects.
